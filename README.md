Google Forms creators have a sleek dashboard from Google. But what about the users who fill out those forms?

This very question inspired me to create GFormSaver, a tailored management tool designed specifically for Google Forms respondents.

## Why it is useful?

  Effortlessly Access and Manage all the stored data with Time-Stamps from a clean and user-friendly webpage.
